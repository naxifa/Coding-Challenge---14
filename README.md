# Coding-Challenge---14

Introduction:
In this challenge, I will create a Customer Support Ticket System that displays support tickets for a business. I will use async/await to handle asynchronous operations, apply try/catch/finally for error handling, and use throw to trigger custom errors. The goal is to simulate how a customer support page retrieves and displays ticket data from an API, with proper error management.

Business Case:
Scenario: A business wants to create a webpage to list unresolved customer support tickets. The tickets are available through an external API, but network issues or missing data could cause the page to break. Your task is to use async/await to fetch the data and ensure errors are caught and managed properly. If no tickets are found, you should throw a custom error stating, “No unresolved tickets available.”
